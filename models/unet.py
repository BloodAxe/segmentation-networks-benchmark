    - "ZF_UNET_224" Model based on UNET code from following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
    - This model used to get 2nd place in DSTL competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection
    - For training used DICE coefficient: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient
    - Input shape for model is 224x224 (the same as for other popular CNNs like VGG or ResNet)
    - It has 3 input channels (to process standard RGB (BGR) images). You can change it with variable "INPUT_CHANNELS"
    - It trained on random image generator with random light shapes (ellipses) on dark background with noise (< 10%).
    - In most cases model ZF_UNET_224 is ok to be used without pretrained weights.
